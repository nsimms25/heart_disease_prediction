Using SKlearn and Keras in Python to predict Heart Disease according to measurements of different patients.

Supervised training using labeled data located in heart.csv, also the scaled data is written to scaled to CSV that was created 
and used to predict.

A poor classifier is the basic Neural Network that is included in the nn_classifier.py
Basic NN classifier has an accuracy around 54%.

But getting better features out of the data during preprocessing in the better_features.py will lead to a much better classifier.
With the better features the accuracy depends slightly based on the pseudorandomness of sklearn but accuracy is around 88%.
